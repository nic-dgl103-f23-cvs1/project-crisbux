                        <p>Churches of Christ have a reputation for placing much stress on the need for baptism.
                            However, we do not emphasize baptism as a "church ordinance," but as a command of Christ.
                            The New
                            Testament teaches baptism as an act which is essential to salvation (Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38;
                            Acts
                            22:16).
                        </p>

                        <p>The only form of baptism we practice in churches of Christ is immersion. The Greek word from
                            which the word baptize comes means "to dip, to immerse, to sub- merge, to plunge." And the
                            Scriptures always point to baptism as a burial (Acts 8:35-39; Romans 6:3,4; Colossians
                            2:12).
                        </p>

                <h2>Salvation</h2>
                <p>Since Christ died for the sins of the whole world and the invitation to share in his saving grace is
                    open to everyone (Acts 10:34,35; Revelation 22:17), we do not believe that anyone is predestined for
                    salvation or condemnation. Some will choose to come to Christ in faith and obedience and will be
                    saved. Others will reject his plea and be condemned (Mark 16:16).</p>
                <p>Wherever you are at this moment, we hope you will decide to accept the salvation offered by Christ -
                    that you will offer yourself in obedient faith and become a member of his church.</p>

                <p><strong>Acts 10:34-35</strong> <br>34 Then Peter began to speak: “I now realize how true it is that

                    right.</p>
                <p><strong>Revelations 22:17</strong> <br>17 The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let the one who
                    hears say, “Come!” Let the one who is thirsty come; and let the one who wishes take the free gift of
                    the water of life..</p>
