                    <p>The head of the church is none other than Jesus Christ (Ephesians 1:22-23).</p>
                    <p class="verse">Ephesians 1:22-23<br> 
                       22 And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, 23 which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.</p>
                    <p>Each congregation of the churches of Christ is autonomous, and it is the Word of God that unites us into One Faith (Ephesians 4:3-6). We follow the teachings of Jesus Christ and his holy Apostles, and not the teachings of man. We are Christians only!</p>
                    <p>We speak where the Bible speaks, and we are silent where the Bible is silent. We are undenominational and have no central headquarters or president.</p>

            <h2>Not a denomination</h2>
            <div class="denomination-content">
                <div>
                    <p>For this reason, we are not interested in man-made creeds, but simply in the New Testament pattern. We do not conceive of ourselves as being a denomination --nor as Catholic, Protestant, or Jewish -- but simply as members of the church which Jesus established and for which he died. And that, incidentally, is why we wear his name.</p>
                    <p>The term "church of Christ" is not used as a denominational designation, but rather as a descriptive term indicating that the church belongs to Christ.</p>
